# keras
models built on keras

building a neural network in keras, and minimizing the errors for the model by performing different things..
in the first project,i.e keras-1 , aimed at making a neural network then split the model into train ,test.. finally using multiple iterations
to minimize the mean squared error.
keras-2 .. aims at the same thing but with a normalized data set
keras-3 aims at the same thing but with a normalized dataset and increasing the number of epochs in various stages , to note the changes
keras-4 -in this we increase the hidden layer in the neural network .
we used adam optimizer for all the model and relu activation function in the hidden layer and no activation function for the output layer.

the reuslts were the best when we increased the hidden layers...
